# MMOTU_DS<sup>2</sup>Net

This repo is the implementation of ["A Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound Image Dataset for Unsupervised Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06799). we refer to  [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) and [MMGeneration](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmgeneration) and mix them to implement unsupervised domain adaptation based segmentation (UDA SEG) task. Many thanks to SenseTime and their two excellent repos.

## Dataset

**Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound (MMOTU) image dataset** consists of two sub-sets with two modalities, which are **OTU\_2d** and **OTU\_CEUS** respectively including **1469 2d ultrasound images** and **170 CEUS images**. On both of these two sub-sets, we provide pixel-wise semantic annotations and global-wise category annotations. **Many thanks to Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University and their excellent works on collecting and annotating the data.**

**MMOTU** : [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c5n0fVKrM9-SZE1kacTXPt1pt844iAs1?usp=sharing) (move OTU_2d and OTU_3d to data folder. Here, OTU_3d folder indicates OTU_CEUS in paper.)

### Install

1. requirements:
    
    python >= 3.7
        
    pytorch >= 1.4
        
    cuda >= 10.0
    
2. prerequisites: Please refer to  [MMSegmentation PREREQUISITES](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html); Please don't forget to install mmsegmentation with

     ```
     cd MMOTU_DS2Net
     
     pip install -e .
     
     chmod 777 ./tools/dist_train.sh
     
     chmod 777 ./tools/dist_test.sh
     ```

### Training

**mit_b5.pth** : [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cmKZgU8Ktg-v-jiwldEc6IghxVSNcFqk?usp=sharing) (Before training Segformer or DS<sup>2</sup>Net_T, loading ImageNet-pretrained mit_b5.pth is very useful. We provide this pretrained backbone here. The pretrained backbone has already been transformed to fit for our repo.)
